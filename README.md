## Graph Design (Time)

### Visualization 1  
a) How does the amount donated vs. amount received change over time across all countries?  
b) Are there countries that mostly send or mostly receive and countries that have a similar amount of donations they receive and send?  
c) Are there countries that change their role over time? That is, they used to mostly send donations and turn into mostly receiving donations and vice-versa?  
d) Are there countries in which you can find a sudden increase ("peak") or a sudden decrease ("valley")?  

### Visualization 2  
a) What are the top 10 purposes of disbursements (in terms of total volume) and how does their volume compare over time?  
b) Are there types that have a much higher/lower volume overall among the top 10?  
c) Are there types that increase or decrease their volume over time or that have sudden peaks or valleys?  

### Visualization 3
a) How does the set of countries Japan sends donations to change over time?  
b) Are there countries that receive higher amounts in specific time periods?
