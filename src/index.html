                    <li>How does the amount donated vs. amount received change over time across all countries?</li>
                    <li>Are there countries that mostly send or mostly receive and countries that have a similar amount of donations they receive and send?</li>
                    <li>Are there countries that change their role over time? That is, they used to mostly send donations and turn into mostly receiving donations and vice-versa?</li>
                    <li>Are there countries in which you can find a sudden increase ("peak") or a sudden decrease ("valley")?</li>
